#CompLabs
This repo hold my work for my Aerodynamics computational labs

##Comp Lab 1 - Computation of Lift and Drag
This lab focuses on the numerical integration of pressure distributions about an aerodynamic body in
order to determine the lift and drag acting forces acting on the body.

##Comp Lab 2 - Computation of Potential Flow
This lab used MATLAB's function pdetool.m to generate numerical PDE solutions to potential flow problems.

##Comp Lab 3 - FLow Over Thin Airfoils
Impliments the superposition of elementary flows to simulate flow over a thin plate.

##Comp Lab 4 - Flow Over Thick Airfoils
This lab adapts Fortran code presented in "Aerodynamic Characteristics of Airfoils" by Kuethe and Chow for MATLAB. The method used here is the vortex panel method, which superposes N discrete vortex panels about an airfoil surface in order to simulate flow effects and characteristics. 

##Comp Lab 5 - Flow Over Finite Wings
Here, Prandtll Lifting Line Theory is implimented to simulate flow over a finite wing of arbitrary span, camber, aerodynamic and geometric twist, taper ratio, and a few other characteristics I'm pretty sure.
