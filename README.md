## CompLabs
This repo hold my work for my Aerodynamics computational labs

# Comp Lab 1 - Computation of Lift and Drag
This lab focuses on the numerical integration of pressure distributions about an aerodynamic body in
order to determine the lift and drag acting forces acting on the body.

# Comp Lab 2 - Computation of Potential Flow
This lab used MATLAB's function pdetool.m to generate numerical PDE solutions to potential flow problems
